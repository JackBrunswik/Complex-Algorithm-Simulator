Project Overview
The Complex Algorithm Simulator is a modeling and simulation project that visualizes and analyzes the dynamic behavior of complex algorithms during execution. Instead of focusing solely on theoretical measures such as Big-O complexity, the simulator models algorithms as evolving systems whose internal states change over discrete simulation steps.

The system implements algorithms such as sorting methods and graph traversal techniques (e.g., Quicksort, Merge Sort, BFS, and Dijkstra’s Algorithm) and treats each algorithmic operation as a discrete event. A centralized simulation engine manages execution flow, state updates, metric collection, and visualization.

The simulator enables step-by-step execution, tracks operation-level metrics (comparisons, swaps, node visits), and supports experimentation with different input sizes and distributions. By combining discrete-event simulation principles with algorithm visualization, the project provides a data-driven framework for analyzing algorithm performance and behavior over time.
